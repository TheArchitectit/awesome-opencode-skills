## Getting Started

### Using Skills in OpenCode

#### Global Installation

1. Install skills to your global OpenCode directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skill/
   cp -r skill-name ~/.config/opencode/skill/
   ```

   Or use the helper script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install_opencode_skills.sh --global
   ```

2. Start OpenCode:
   ```bash
   opencode
   ```

3. The skill loads automatically and activates when relevant.

#### Project-Local Installation

1. Install skills to your project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .opencode/skill/
   cp -r skill-name .opencode/skill/
   ```

   Or use the helper script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install_opencode_skills.sh --project
   ```

2. Start OpenCode in your project:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   opencode
   ```

 3. Skills are discovered from `.opencode/skill/` directories.

### MCP Server for Skill Management 🚀

**NEW:** Manage OpenCode skills easier with our MCP server! The server provides 8 tools to browse, install, search, and manage OpenCode skills from within OpenCode.

---

## Getting Started with the MCP Server

### Step 1: Choose Your Runtime

#### TypeScript/Node.js (Recommended)
- Faster startup (~20ms with bun, ~50ms with node)
- Smaller memory footprint (~35MB)
- Modern npm/bun ecosystem
- Type-safe with Zod schemas

**Build the server:**

```bash
cd opencode-skills-mcp-server-ts

# Using npm
npm install && npm run build

# Using bun
bun install && bun run build
```

#### Python
- Mature PyPI ecosystem
- Familiar Python patterns
- Comprehensive logging to file + console
- Runtime type checking with Pydantic

**Build the server:**

```bash
cd opencode-skills-mcp-server

# Using the setup script (recommended)
./setup.sh

# Or manually
pip install -e .
```

---

### Step 2: Configure OpenCode

Add the MCP server to your OpenCode config file. The config location depends on your OS:

**Linux/macOS:** `~/.config/opencode/config.json`  
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\opencode\config.json`

**Option A: Using node (TypeScript compiled)**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "opencode-skills": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["node"],
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/opencode-skills-mcp-server-ts/dist/index.js"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B: Using bun (TypeScript with bun)**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "opencode-skills": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["bun"],
      "args": ["run", "/absolute/path/to/opencode-skills-mcp-server-ts/src/index.ts"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Option C: Using python (Python runtime)**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "opencode-skills": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["python3"],
      "args": ["-m", "opencode_skills_mcp"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Tips for paths:**
- Use absolute paths (e.g., `/home/user/...` or `C:\Users\...`)
- Or use home expansion with `{env:HOME}` on Linux/macOS
- Make sure the path matches your chosen runtime (TypeScript needs `dist/index.js`, Python can use module import)

---

### Step 3: Restart OpenCode

Restart OpenCode to load the MCP server:

```bash
# Stop OpenCode (Ctrl+C)
opencode
```

The MCP server will start automatically when OpenCode launches, and the 8 skill management tools will be available.

---

### Step 4: Use the MCP Tools

Once configured, you can use the MCP tools directly in OpenCode:

```bash
# List all available skills
/list_skills

# List skills filtered by category
/list_skills with category "Development"

# Get detailed information about a skill
/get_skill_info for skill "content-research-writer"

# Install a skill globally
/install_skill with skill_name "file-organizer" and scope "global"

# Search for skills
/search_skills with query "document processing"

# Get recommended skill combinations
/get_combinations with category "Writing"

# Install an entire workflow
/install_workflow with workflow_name "content-pipeline" and scope "global"

# Validate a skill structure
/validate_skill with skill_path "/path/to/skill/directory"
```

---

## MCP Server Options

Your config supports additional options for customization:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "opencode-skills": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["node"],
      "args": ["/path/to/opencode-skills-mcp-server-ts/dist/index.js"],
      "enabled": true,
      "timeout": 5000,
      "environment": {
        "SKILLS_DIR": "/custom/path/to/skills"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Available options:**
- `enabled` - Enable or disable the server (default: `true`)
- `timeout` - Timeout in ms for loading tools (default: `5000`)
- `environment` - Environment variables for the server (e.g., custom skills path)

---

## Disabling the MCP Server

To temporarily disable the MCP server without removing it from your config:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "opencode-skills": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["node"],
      "args": ["/path/to/opencode-skills-mcp-server-ts/dist/index.js"],
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

Or disable all tools from the server globally:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "opencode-skills": { /* ... */ }
  },
  "tools": {
    "opencode-skills*": false
  }
}
```

---

## Per-Agent Configuration

If you use multiple agents, you can enable the MCP server per-agent instead of globally:

**OpenCode Config (disable globally):**

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "opencode-skills": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["node"],
      "args": ["/path/to/opencode-skills-mcp-server-ts/dist/index.js"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  "tools": {
    "opencode-skills*": false
  }
}
```

**Agent Config (enable for specific agent):**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "agent": {
    "developer-assistant": {
      "tools": {
        "opencode-skills*": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP server doesn't start

1. **Check path is absolute:** Use full paths, not relative paths
2. **Verify dependencies are installed:** Run `npm install` or `pip install -e .`
3. **Check file permissions:** Ensure the entry point file is executable
4. **Review logs:** Check `logs/opencode_skills_mcp.log` (Python version)

### Tools not appearing

1. **Restart OpenCode** after adding config
2. **Check `enabled: true`** is set in your config
3. **Verify syntax:** Ensure JSON is valid (no syntax errors)
4. **Check timeout:** Increase `timeout` if tools take time to load (default: 5000ms)

### Skills not found

1. **Ensure skills_metadata.json exists** in the MCP server directory
2. **Check SKILLS_DIR environment** if you customized the path
3. **Verify skill directory** exists in your awesome-opencode-skills repository

**MCP Tools Available:**
- `list_skills` - Browse all skills with filters
- `get_skill_info` - View detailed skill information
- `install_skill` - Install skills globally/locally
- `uninstall_skill` - Remove skills
- `search_skills` - Find skills by keywords
